The Python code randomly selects a group of 500+ cities across the world. Then, the code collects data from the OpenWeatherMap API to create a representatitve model of weather across world cities. The API data is used to graph the following relationships:
Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
From the analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn:
Temperature seems to have a clear correlation with latitude
As expected, the weather becomes significantly warmer as one approaches the equator (0 Deg. Latitude). The southern hemisphere tends to be warmer this time of year than the northern hemisphere
There is no strong relationship between latitude and cloudiness. However, it is interesting to see that a strong band of cities near 0, 80, and 90% cloudiness
There is no strong relationship between latitude and wind speed. However, in northern hemispheres there is a flurry of cities with over 20 mph of wind
Wind speed tends to generally be betweeen 0 and 15 mph regardless of latitude
There is no strong relationship between latitude and humidity. however there is a slightly larger cluster of northern hemisphere cities with high humidity (above 60% humidity)
The same analysis is also used in a mockup website for another project. See the following link: https://mileslucey.github.io/weatherpy_website/
